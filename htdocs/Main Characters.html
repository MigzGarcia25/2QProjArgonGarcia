						Hachiman Hikigaya is the main protagonist of the series. He is a teenage male with average height and containing medium-short length black hair.
						He is a student of Class 2F and during his free time, he serves the school by being part of the Sobu High Service Club. Usually, he dresses with the
						Sobu High Uniform but occassionally, he wears a long sleeve undershirt and a casual orange T-Shirt. His good qualities were his intelligence, and his
						powers of elimination.
						<br>
						<br>
						He first appeared on the first chapter on the light novel where in he was called out by Hiratsuka-sensei to join the service club as punishment for
						writing his essay about "high school life". But the truth is, Hiratsuka did it so that Hachiman himself can learn about the real high school life.

							<h3>His most iconic quotes about life were:</h3>
						</div>
						
						<div id="Quotes">
							<ul>
								<li>"The past makes you want to die out of regret, and the future makes you depressed out of anxiety, so by elimination, the present is
								likely the happiest time.</li>
								<li>"I believe that everyone is born unique, but through the years we work very hard to be like everyone else."</li>
								<li>"If they don't know you personally, don't take it personally."
								<li>"Working hard alone doesn't assure you that you'll achieve your dreams. Actually, there are more cases where you don't. Even so, working hard
								and achieving something is some consolation at least."</li>
								<li>"If wishes could be granted, if desires could be fulfilled, then I wouldn't wish or desire for anything after all. The things that you're handed on a
								silver platter are never genuine, and never everlasting. And that's why I'll always keep searching."</li>
								<li>"So long as a problem doesn't cause a problem, it can't be called a problem.</li>

						Yukino Yukinoshita is the female protagonist of the series. She is a pretty teenage girl with waist-length black hair tied with two red ribbons by each shoulder.
						She is a student of Class 2J and during her free time, serves the school by being part of the Sobu High Service Club. She's smart, but then has a tendency to be
						blunt and often points out faults in other people. Hachiman nicknames her as the "Ice Queen " for being very cold and unfriendly towards him. Ironically, at the
						end of the series, she was able to end up with him.
						<br>
						<br>
						She first appeared in the first chapter sitting on one of the chairs of the Service Club room, while reading a tiny light novel. That was the scene when Yukino and
						Hachiman, met for the first time since an accident where in Yukino's car accidentally hit Hachiman when he attempted to save Yui's dog from being hit (he succeeded).

						Yui Yuigahama is another female protagonist of the series. She has a loose, shoulder length, chestnut-brown hair that would sway when she walked. She is also
						mentioned to not follow the dress code. She is a student of Class 2F and during her free time, serves the school by also being part of the Sobu High Service Club.

						typical good looking, dumb, famous girl.
						<br>
						<br>
						She first appeared in the first chapter when she became the first customer of the service club. Eventually, after that she became the third member of the club
						by joining Hachiman and Yukino. The three were all related in an incident where in Hachiman jumps in to the road to save Yui's puppy and got hit by Yukino's car.
