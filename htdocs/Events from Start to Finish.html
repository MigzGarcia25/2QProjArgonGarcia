						Despite preferring to be a loner, Hachiman Hikigaya is forced as a punishment, to join the Sobu High School service club alongside Class 2J's
						Yukinoshita Yukino, and Class 2F's Yuigahama Yui. Also being linked by a car accident in the past, they offer to help their batchmates
						dealing with the struggles and complicated psychology of being a high schooler. Every episode introduces a new side character in need of help.
						At the end of the season, the service club performs a mini concert in front of the school.

					<div id="SeasonDesc">
						<p>
						The second season is a lot more different as it introduces a new art style for the anime. It also introduced a main deuteragonist in the series
						named Isshiki Iroha who just became the president of the Student Council and asked for the aid of the Service Club in numerous events. It is also the
						season where in the two female protagonists began to develop feelings for Hachiman. Hikigaya finds out that the Service Club trio was just a team
						that relies on each other heavily.

						<p>
						The last season of the series was a series compressed into a huge prom arc. The Service Club alongside the Student Council President attempted
						to create a prom for the Sobu High School. The Service Club was split into two, for Yukino wanted to create her own prom without wanting to depend on Hachiman. 
						The winner was said to grant a wish from the loser, and fortunately for her she won. Yukino, being the selfless person she is, asked her wish to be Yui's. Nearing the end of the season,
						Hachiman and Yukino conveyed their feelings despite lacking communication and socializing skills.
