					<p>Though the protagonist may be edgy for some people, it makes it a very unique type of anime. 
					Yahari Ore No Seishun Rabukome Wa Machigatteiru is well known for having one of the best anime protagonists ever. I am talking about Hikigaya Hachiman.
					If you might like shows which showcases an introverted main character and how he views each aspect of life. This is definitely the best show for anybody 
					like that. The way he views life in a different way compared to others is very satisfying.

				<div id="ReasonsDesc">
					<p>One that is not mostly talked about in this series is the art. Oregairu contains one of the best art style in anime. The shift of art from the first season to second and
					last made the show much more attractive than before. The details of the drawings had much more emphasis. The backgrounds, shadows, animation, looked very beautiful because of it.
					Many diehards hated this because they felt like the old art style of the show should have been the one used. The change 
					of art style occurs very rarely. But even so, the show still looked fantastic because of its new approach.

				<div id="ReasonsDesc">
						<p>The first season comprises of mostly comedy while as the second and last seasons contained some of the best drama in anime. The so called "codependence" of the main trio
						circulated in the whole show which caused awkwardness among them that eventually lead the two girls to developing slightly romantic feelings. It's not like any romance
						comedy show. The drama between the trio gets spicier after every season with a bunch of heartbreaking moments.
